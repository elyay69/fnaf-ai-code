# fnaf-ai-code
this is the code for a bot I made to play fnaf 2
In case you want to try this out and you're 5:
Requierments:
-A PC (Windows/Macos/Linuxos...)
-Python 3.9
-PIP 

Steps:
-go to terminal and write "pip3 install pyautogui"
-After the installation, write "python3 fnaf.py"
-Open fnaf 2 with the chosen night (the AI will start doing it's shit after 30 seconds of running)

Enjoy. Or don't.
